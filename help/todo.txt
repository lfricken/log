1500 to schwab

unfair score bonus in GetScoreDelta from ties
everyone disconnected timeout
prevent name changes after game starts
main menu/lobby finder/about page
settings manipulation
settings validation
kick player
lobby password
about page
remove debug messages






add to ideas: 
techs should be publicly revealed
random money bonuses/other asymetry?
(global project that earns all surviving players extra stuff)
pass events to player server player functions
dynamic trading (each player has more than 2 options)
Send each other money. For instance: The target recieves your gift + 50%. So two players send 4 each but get 6 back.



LobbyJoin needs submit event
redo Chat with onChange and propper submit event
