test view models
setup client
LastEvents test
everyone disconnected timeout
game end timeout
try out everything


models need events or something?

add to ideas: 
(global project that earns all surviving players extra stuff)
pass events to player server player functions
dynamic trading (each player has more than 2 options)
Send each other money. For instance: The target recieves your gift + 50%. So two players send 4 each but get 6 back.



LobbyJoin needs submit event
redo Chat with onChange and propper submit event





```
// server
import * as exp from "express";
import * as http from "http";
import * as io from "socket.io";

const expWrap = express();
const httpServer = http.createServer(expWrap);
const ioWrap = new io.Server(httpServer);
ioWrap.on("connect", (socket: io.Socket) =>
{
	console.log(`Socket ${socket.id} connected.`);
	socket.on("disconnect", () =>
	{
		console.log(`Socket ${socket.id} disconnected.`);
	}
}
```

```
// client react component
import io from "socket.io-client";

constructor(props: Props)
{
	this.socket = io();
}

```
