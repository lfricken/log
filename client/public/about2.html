<p>
Externalities is a simultaneous, turn-based, multiplayer strategy game designed to be played in any browser, preferably with a group of 6 or more people you know. Join a game <a href="/game/example_lobby_id">by clicking here</a>. You can go to a custom lobby ID by modifying the url.
</p>
<p>
The gameplay mechanics are purely designed from the following problems in game theory, while the title refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">another</a>. The general goal was to recreate the conditions of our ancestors, in an attempt to demonstrate why global cooperation at todays scale has taken so long, as well as the obstacles we still face.

<h3>Prisoner Delima and Zero Sum Games</h3>
<p>
You can trade with your neighbors or steal from them! Trading is mutually beneficial in the long run, but stealing can offer quick gains. Two parties that only spend time stealing from eachother, rather than productive activities, will never gain resources. Parties that never retaliate by stealing back will be taken advantage of.
</p>
<h3>Arms Races and Games of Chicken</h3>
<p>
Billions of dollars are spent yearly on missiles that sit in silos, unused. Resources that could have gone towards _anything else_ are wasted. But states that fail to invest sufficiently in defense risk getting invaded.
</p>
<h3>Political Alliances</h3>
<p>
You can only gain resources through interactions with your neighbors, so you need to prevent them from dying, no matter what shenanigans they're up to, or you will likely die soon after.
